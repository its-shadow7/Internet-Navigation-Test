**Internet Veteran** is a satirical browser-based game that tests your ability to navigate the hostile environment of the modern internet. From misleading download buttons and guilt-tripping unsubscribe moduls to tech support scams and difficult captchas, this game challenges your digital street smarts.

## ✨ Features

* **Dark Pattern Simulation:** Navigate through deceptive UI designs meant to trick you.
* **Scam Awareness:** Identify fake "Virus Alerts" and "You Won an iPhone" pop-ups.
* **Reflex Testing:** A built-in reaction time test (must be under 269ms!).
* **Custom Captcha:** A visual captcha that actually requires you to identify objects.

* **Certificate Generation:** Upon completion, generate a personalized "Certified Internet Veteran" certificate that can be downloaded as a PDF.

## 🕹️ Levels Overview

The game consists of several distinct levels found in `InternetVetern.js`:

1.  **Robot Check:** Find the *actual* close button on a fake security popup.
2.  **Real Download:** Identify the correct download link among ads and fake buttons.
3.  **Cookie Consent:** Try to reject cookies when the UI tries to force you to accept.
4.  **Unsubscribe:** Face the emotional manipulation of an unsubscribe screen.
5.  **Virus Alert:** Close a fake "Critical Error" tech support scam window.

9.  **iPhone Scam:** A simulated WhatsApp sharing scam.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** Custom animations (`@keyframes shake`), responsive design, and `@media print` for the certificate.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla):** DOM manipulation, game logic, state management, and event handling.
* **FontAwesome:** For icons.
* **Google Fonts:** Playfair Display, Roboto, and Cookie.

## 📄 Certificate & Printing

The project utilizes specific CSS print media queries (`@media print`). When you complete the game and click **"Download PDF"**, the browser hides the game interface and only renders the high-resolution certificate for a clean export.
