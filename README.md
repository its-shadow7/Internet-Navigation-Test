**Internet Veteran** is a satirical browser-based game that tests your ability to navigate the hostile environment of the modern internet. From misleading download buttons and guilt-tripping unsubscribe moduls to tech support scams and difficult captchas, this game challenges your digital street smarts.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

## 📄 Certificate & Printing

The project utilizes specific CSS print media queries (`@media print`). When you complete the game and click **"Download PDF"**, the browser hides the game interface and only renders the high-resolution certificate for a clean export.
